The code runs through terminal commands. For part1 run /py a1part1.py, or /python a1part1.py, it depends on your local environment. For part 2 run /py a1part1.py.

The assignment code relies on numpy to generate numbers on a normal distribution and matplotlib to plot the graphs and won't run without both.

The graphs generated in a1part2 in order are
-Permuted means, with the bars corresponding to Optimistic, Decreasing step size Epsilon, and Fixed step size Epsilon in order.
-Drift change, with the bars corresponding to Optimistic, Decreasing step size Epsilon, and Fixed step size Epsilon in order.
-Mean reverting change, with the bars corresponding to Optimistic, Decreasing step size Epsilon, and Fixed step size Epsilon in order.
